#SuperElastix image registation toolbox

The objective of image registration is to find the spatial
relationship between two or more images.
In the last decades numerous image registration methods
and tools have emerged from the research community.
Implementation of these methods, however, are scattered
over a plethora of toolboxes each with their own interface,
limitations and modus operandi.

SuperElastix is a joint effort of the Biomedical Imaging Group Rotterdam ([BIGR](http://www.bigr.nl/website/)) of Erasmus University Medical Center, The Netherlands, and the Division of Image Processing ([LKEB](http://www.lkeb.nl)) of Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands, to provide an open
source, multi-platform image registration toolbox written in C++. SuperElastix
aims at covering a wide range of image registration methodologies in a single experience, while considering both user-friendliness and algorithm modularity.
